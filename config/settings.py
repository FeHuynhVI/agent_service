"""
Wrapper for settings configuration.

This module reâ€‘exports the :mod:`settings` module from the project
root to preserve compatibility with code that expects a
``config.settings`` package.  By importing :class:`Settings` and the
``settings`` instance from here, other modules can continue to work
without changes after refactoring the project structure.
