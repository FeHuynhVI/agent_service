Physics Expert Agent

This module defines the :class:`PhysicsExpertAgent`, a subject
specialist for physics.  It inherits from :class:`SubjectExpertAgent`
to leverage common functionality such as system message construction and
LLM configuration.  The physics expert has a broad range of knowledge
spanning mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics and modern
physics.  Methods are provided to solve physics problems and explain
concepts in depth.

See the AutoGen AgentChat user guide for guidance on creating
multiâ€‘agent systems:
