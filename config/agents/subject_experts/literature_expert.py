Literature Expert Agent

This module defines the :class:`LiteratureExpertAgent`, a subject
expert focused on literature analysis and writing.  Like other
specialized experts in this project, it inherits from
``SubjectExpertAgent`` to reuse base functionality.  The literature
expert can analyze texts, provide writing advice and discuss literary
history.

Refer to the AutoGen AgentChat user guide for design patterns when
building multiâ€‘agent systems:
