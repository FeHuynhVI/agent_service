"""
Agents package for the AutoGen Education Service.

This package provides backwardsâ€‘compatibility wrappers around agent
classes defined at the project root.  It also organizes subject
expert agents under the ``subject_experts`` subpackage to mirror the
expected structure.  Importing from ``agents.base_agent`` or
``agents.subject_experts.math_expert`` will forward to the
corresponding module at the project root.
