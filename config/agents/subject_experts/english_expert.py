English Language Expert Agent

This module defines the :class:`EnglishExpertAgent`, a subject
expert for English language learning.  It inherits from
``SubjectExpertAgent`` to reuse base functionality and tailors the
system message to language education.  The English expert can explain
grammar rules, build vocabulary and help with pronunciation and
communication skills.

Guidance on multiâ€‘agent system design can be found in the AutoGen
AgentChat user guide:
